# Seats in a Theater
	Algorithm assumes you are getting up to leave 
	a movie theater, and finds number of people you will
	block on the way out. Takes in number or total rows, total
	columns in the theater, and your current row and current column you
	are in. I solved by multiplying the total clomuns minus current column
	times the total rows - current row plus one(added one, they assumed you
	wont block people in your own row for this problem).
