# Factorialze Number
	Here the objective is to take in a number and 
	return the product of every number between it
	and 1 times it.

	I solved by creating a for loop that started at
	the number minus one, that went back by one on each
	iteration to 0. Then on each iteration I multiplied
	the number param by the current index.
