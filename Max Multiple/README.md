# Max Multiple
	 Algorithm takes in 2 numbers, one represents a number
	to be divided by, and the other represents the largest
	possible number to output. The goal is to return the largest
	possible number that is less than or equal to the 2nd inputted number,
	and divisible by the first. 
	I solved by using a while loop starting at the 2nd input value, and
	decrementing it by 1 each time it wasn't divisible by the first. Then
	returned the result of thaat variable
