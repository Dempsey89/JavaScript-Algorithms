# Contains Duplicate
	This algorithms objective is to take in an array, and return whether
	or not it has any duplicate items. I sloved by first setting a variable
	to an empty array, then another set to false. Then I did a forEach loop
	through the array paramater, and used the indexOf method to compare
	whether the new array I created had that value or not. If it did, then
	I changed the second variable created to true, if it didn't then I added
	it to it.
