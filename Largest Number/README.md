# Largest Number
	Takes in a number paramater, returns
	larges possible number with that numbers
	amount of digits. I first solved by setting empty
	string as a variable, then adding 9 to it
	on each iteration of a loop going to the
	numbers amount in a for loop. Then I returned
	the parseInt value of that string.
	Then I used the repeat method, to repeat '9'
	the number of times of the number, and then 
	return its parseInt value.
