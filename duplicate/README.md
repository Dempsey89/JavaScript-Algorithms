# Duplicate test
    This function returns true if an array has a number value more than once, and false if not. To achieve this I first
    used the sort function to put the numbers in numerical order. Then I created a for loop which returns true if the
    value of the arrays index is equal to the value of the arrays index minus one. If it goes through the loop without
    hitting a true, it will return false after.
