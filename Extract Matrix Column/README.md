# Extract Matrix Column
	This algorithm takes in a multidemensional array and 
	a number, and returns the index of each array within the 
	array of the specified number paramater. 

	To solve this I first created a variable equal to an empty array. 
	Then I looped through the multidemensional array, and pushed each
	value of the number given at each index of this array.
