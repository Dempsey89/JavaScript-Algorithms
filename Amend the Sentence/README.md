# Ammend the sentence
	This function took in a string that was written with no spaces and instead
	capital letters that signaled a new word, and turned that string into a readable
	sentence. To do this I split the sentence at any point where a lowercase and upper
	case letter met, then returned that value with the join and toLowerCase method
	called on it.
