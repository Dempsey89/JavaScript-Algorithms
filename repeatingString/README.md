# Repeating a string

  The objective of this challenge was to 
  take in a string and a number as paramaters, 
  and return the string the number of times of
  the number paramater. 
  
  To solve this I created a variable equal to 
  an empty string, then created a for loop that
  added the str to the variable until the loop went
  through the amount of times as the number given.
  
  Then returned the variable.
