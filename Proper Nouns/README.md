# Proper noun
	This algorithm takes in a word as a string, and returns it
	with the first letter capitalized and the rest of the word
	in lower case. 
	I solved by creating a variable equal to the first index of the
	string and used the toUpperCase method on it. Then made another
	variable equal to the word sliced from 0 to the end of the word, 
	and used the toLowerCase method on it. Then I returned the 2
	variables added together.
