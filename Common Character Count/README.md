# Common Character Count
	Here the objective was to take in two strings, and return the amount of
	characters they have in common with each other. 

	I solved by initializing a variable to 0, then splitting both strings. 
	Then I looped through the first array created from the split, and within
	it itterated through second. Every time a character from the first matched
	one from the second, I added one to my initial variable and spliced that value
	from the first array.
