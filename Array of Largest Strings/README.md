# Array of largest strings
	This algorithm takes in an array of strings, and then returns an array with
	any of those strings that's length is equal to the largest length of the 
	strings from that array.
	
	First I set a variable equal to zero. Then I looped through the array, and replaced
	the variable any time the length of the current index I was on was greater than
	that value by using a ternary statement.

	Then I filtered through the string returning any string that's length was equal
	to that variable.
