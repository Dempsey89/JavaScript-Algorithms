# First Duplicate
	Algorithm takes in an array, and returns the value of the first time there
	are two of the same values in a row, unless there are none in which case
	it returns -1.

	Solved by looping through the array, and using and if statement to return
	the value of the current index if it was equal to the value of the next index, 

	then it would return -1 if it looped through without running into that scenario.
