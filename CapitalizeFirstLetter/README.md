# Capitalize First Letter of Each Word

   Here is an algorithm I solved which takes a string, and returns it with the first letter of each word capitalized.
   To do this I first split the string, then mapped it to return first character of each word in the array by slicing 
   from 0-1, capitalized that letter and then concated it with the rest of the word by slicing it from 1 to the strings length.

   -I also showed example of how this function works in the html section of this document under the opening div tag.
