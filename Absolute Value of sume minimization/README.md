#Absolute Value Sum Minization
	Here the objective was basically to get the median out of an array of numbers
	To do this I created variable that stored a ternary. If the length of the
	array was even, the variable would equal the length of the array divided by two
	minus one. If it was odd then it would equal the length plus one, divided by two
	and then minus one again. Then I would return the value at this point in the
	array's value
