# Absolute Value of Largest Difference
	Here the Objective was to take in an array, subtract each number from the number prior
	to it, and return the absolute value of the largest difference. To do this I first 
	subtracted the second value from the first and stored the absolute value resulting 
	into a vatiable. Then I looped through all the remaining values subtracting the next
	value up from it, and if the absolute value of any of these differences were greater
	than the initial variable I set up, I replaced it with this new absolute value. 
	
	One done looping through I returned the value of that variable.
