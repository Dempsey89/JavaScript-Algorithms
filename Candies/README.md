# Candies
	This algorithm takes in two paramaters, one that serves as the total amount 
	of kids that will be getting candy, and the other to serve as the amount of 
	candy that is available. The objective is make sure each kid will get the same
	amount and the most that is available, then return total amount of candy that
	will be given

	Solved this by using the Math.floor method on the amount of candy divided by
	the amount of kids, and then multiplying that number by the amount of kids.
