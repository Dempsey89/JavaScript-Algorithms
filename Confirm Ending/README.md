# Confirm Ending
	This algorithm takes in two strings, and compares if the ending
	of the first string is equal to the value of the second. I 
	solved this by returning a boolean for whether the first string
	called with the substr method starting from the difference of 
	the first strings length minus the strings second length, and
	compared if that value was equal to string two.
