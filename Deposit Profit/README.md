# Deposit Profit
	Here the objective was to take in 3 numbers, one
	represnted a deposit you would be puttting down, the next
	the rate of interest you would get annually on it, and the last
	a total amount of money you were trying to get to from just the
	dep and the interest. The objective was to return how many 
	years it would take.

	I first solved using a for loop, and adding the dep times the
	int divided by 100, and incremented a year var by 1 until the 
	total amount got over the goal amount.

	Then I solved it again doing the same thing, but with a while loop.
	I think the while loop is a little cleaner since it it shorter
