# Character Parity
	This algorithm takes in a string character as a paramater, and returns whether
	that character was odd, even, or not a number. 

	I solved this by first creating a variable that used the parseInt method on the
	string. Then I made an if else statement that returned the value of that var if 
	it was NaN, and if not it returned a ternary for whether it was even or odd.
