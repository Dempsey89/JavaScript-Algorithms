# Sum of Differences
	Here the objective was to take in an array, and return the sum of all the 
	numbers from the smallest to the largest of the numbers in that array
	added together. 

	To do this I first sorted the numbers from least to greatest, then looped
	from the value of the least to the value of the greatest adding each value
	to a variable I initiated at 0 outside of the loop.
