# Sum of All Prime
	Takes in a number, and returns the sum of all
	prime numbers that exist from 1 to that number. 
	I solved by initiating a variable to 0, and another
	to an empty array. Then I looped through the input array, 
	and added the current index to the 0 variable, and pushed it
	to the array variable if the array variable using the map method
	with the current index divided by each number in that array did
	not include a 0. Then I returned the variable that was initially 
	0.
