# Is Tandem
	Takes in a string, and returns whether the first hald
	of the string is the same value as the second half of it.
	Solved by first returning false if the string length was
	odd. Then I created a variable equal to the string length
	divided by 2. I used this variable to create 2 new variables, 
	one being the string sliced at that position, then next
	then string sliced from that position to the end of the string.
	Then I compared those 2 variables to see if they were equal
	using a boolean return
