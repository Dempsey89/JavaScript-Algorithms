# Fermactor
	Here the goal is to take in a number, 
	and return an array of 2 numbers. The first
	number squared minus the 2nd number squared should
	equal the initial number taken in.

	I solved by looping up to the the number amount starting at
	one, and within the loop looping through each number represented
	by the initial iteration going to the length of that prev loop.
	Then I created a variable that was the first iterations index squard
	minus the second iterations index squared. 
	If that number was equal to the initial number taken in, I would
	return the index of each in an array.
