# Slicing and splicing
	Here the objective was to take in 3 paramaters. The first two were arrays, 
	and the third was a number. The goal was to add the values of the first array
	into the second array starting at the number paramater entered

	I solved this by first creating a variable equal to the second array sliced 
	from 0 to the number given, then another variable that equaled the second array
	spliced at the number.

	Then I concated the second array to the first variable created, and then concated
	the second variable on to that new value.
