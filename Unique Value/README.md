# Unique Values
	Here the objective was to take in two arrays as paramaters, and return
	an array with any value that occured in one but not the other. 

	I started this algorithim by creating an empty array, then I looped through
	the first array and pushed any value that wasn't included in the second
	(via includes method) to the empty array created, then I did the same
	thing  but looped through the second array and pushed any values not 
	included in the first.
