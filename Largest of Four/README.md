# Largest of Four
	This algorithm takes in array of arrays, and returns an array of the largest value of each of the
	arrays. I solced by first creating a variable of an empty array. Then I looped thorugh
	the inputed array, and sorted each sub array from smallest to largest. Then pushed
	the last value of this sorted array to my array variable I initially created.
