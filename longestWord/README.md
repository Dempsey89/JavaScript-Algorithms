# Return longest word in a string

  This challenge was to return the longest word of a string. I
  ended up doing two solutions.For both I created a variable that 
  split the string param anywhere a alphabetical character wasn't
  placed into an array. Then created a variable equal to an empty
  array.
  
## Solution one
  
  For this solution I looped through the values of the first array
  with a for loop, and changed the value of the second variable I created
  to the value of the indexed value in this array if it's length was longer
  then the second variables length. 
  
  Then returned the ans variable value after the loop was done.
  
## Solution two

  This solution used a forEach function on the original created array
  and used a ternary statement to change the value of the ans array to 
  the value of the indexed value if it's length was longer than the ans array
  length. 
  
  From there returned the ans value.
