# Domain Type
	Here the goal was to take in an array of domains, and
	return just the type of each. I solved by creating a variable
	set to an empty array, then looped through the array. 
	On each iteration I split the string at the dot. Then
	I used an if else statement to return the proper domain
	type based on each remaining string.
