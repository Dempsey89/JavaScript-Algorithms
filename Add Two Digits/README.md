# Add Two Digits
	This Algorithm is meant to take in any two digit number as a paramater, 
	and add the two digits together. I accomplished this by storing the number
	as a split string array into a variable. Then I used the reduce method on the
	array to add the parseInt value of each item in the array and return the sum.
