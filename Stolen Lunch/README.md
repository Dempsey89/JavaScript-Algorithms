# Solen Lunch
	Takes in a string, where the objective is to return
	as a code with values a-j equalling 0-9, and 0-9 equalling
	a-j. Solved by creating an object storing all values, then 
	looping through the string after splitting it, and adding
	the value of the code if it matched the object, or the value
	of the string array if not, to an empty string variable that
	I returned in the end.
