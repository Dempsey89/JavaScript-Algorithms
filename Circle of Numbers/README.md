# Circle of Numbers
	Obj to take in two numbers. First represents circle with that many points, 
	the second represents a specific point on that circle. Goal is to return 
	number that is opposite of that specific number on the circle.

	Solved by setting up variable that represented halfway point of circle, 
	then returning the initial point given plus or minus the halfpoint based 
	on if it is larger or smaller than it by using a ternary.
