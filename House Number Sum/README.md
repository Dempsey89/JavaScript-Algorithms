# House Number Sum
	This algorithm Takes in array, and adds the sum of all numbers until a 		
	value of 0 comes up. Solved by setting a variable to 0. Then looped 			
	through the array, and added the value of each index, unless it was 0, at 		
	which point I returned the value of the variable.
