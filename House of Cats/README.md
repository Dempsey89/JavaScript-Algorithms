# House of Cats
	This algorithm Takes in a number that represents total amount of 
	legs in a house between cats and people. Returns array in numerical 
	order of possible people in the house based on that number of legs. 
	Sets a variable to an array with one value already in it, which is the 	input value divided by 2.
	Then, a while loop is called for while the input value is greater 
	than 4, it will decrement by 4 and the new number divided
	by 2 will be unshifted to the array variable.
