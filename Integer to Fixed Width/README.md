# Integer to Fixed Width
	This algorithm takes in a 2 numbers as paramater, and return the first 	number with the amount of digits as the second numbers value.
	Used an if statemtent for 3 possible scenarios. One being if length was 	already equal to 2nd number, returned it. Next if
	number was greater than 1st numbers length, I used a while loop to unshift 	0 to it until it no longer was less than the second
	number. Then, if it was less then the number, I sliced it at the numbers 	value.
