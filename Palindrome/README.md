# Palindrome test

 For this algorithm I took in a string defined var as quotes, defined a new var
 that returned the param entered but replaced anything that wasn't an alphabetical
 character with an empty string, ans then converted every value to lowercase. Then
 looped through this array that was created with a for loop starting from the back
 and going doen to zero and added each index to the original variable, and returned
 a boolean for whether the two variables matched or not.
