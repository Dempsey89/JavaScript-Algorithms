# Fist Digit
	Here the goal was to take in a string, and
	return the value of the first digit found
	in that string. I solved by initially creating
	an array with the values of numbers 1-9 (and 0),
	then I looped through the array paramater, and
	returned any index where the variable I created 
	included the current index value of the 
	array paramater.
