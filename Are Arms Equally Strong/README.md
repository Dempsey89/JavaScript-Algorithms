# Are arms equally strong?
	This algorithm took in four paramaters that represented each of your arms, and
	each of you friends arms, and compared if you were both equally strong or not.
	To do this I stored your stronger arm and weaker arm and your friends stronger
	and weaker arm as variables using ternary statements to decipher which was 
	the stronger of each persons arm. Then returned a boolean on if your strongest
	equaled your friends and your weakest equaled your friends.
